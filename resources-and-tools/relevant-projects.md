DataLumos\
Created by the UM-ISR Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) this is an open-access archive, DataLumos, where the public can archive valuable government data resources, ensuring their long-term availability.

**Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online** (SUCHO) https://www.sucho.org/ \
Initiative focused on Ukrainian Digital Cultural Heritage. It was kind of modeled off of Data rescue v01 but a little more broad in terms of what to “save” and there were different threats, because the physical infrastructure was also in danger.
