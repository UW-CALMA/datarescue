# üè• Data Rescues 2025

In response to political threats to social, environmental, health, and personal data, the [University of Washington Center for Advances in Libraries, Museums, and Archives (CALMA)](https://calma.ischool.uw.edu/) in collaboration with Seattle-based BKS Studio, is hosting a series of DATA RESCUE efforts. If you are also concerned about losing access to vital public government data and files, you are in the right place!

Modeled after the 2016-2017 DataRescue movement that responded to hostile conditions towards environmental and climate science data, these ad hoc digital archiving volunteer events invite community members to apply their technical skills and social values in response to new threats to important data. While Data Rescues can focus on any type of at-risk public and government data, many have focused on environmental issues given[ documented threats and modifications](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246450) by recent political agendas.&#x20;

This Gitbook is a knowledge base for the 2025 Seattle-based Data Rescues events. Open to public suggestions and contributions, this is a living document that is created and informed by documentation and literature from the 2017-2018 Data Rescues and by community-informed brainstorming discussions.&#x20;

The following Gitbook pages include:

* [Background](what-are-data-rescues.md) information on the history of past Data Rescue efforts
* Guide on [How To Start](how-to-start/) contributing to Data Rescues goals
* Detailed instructions on contributing to Data Rescue [Task Workflows](how-to-start/)
* A growing list of [Learning Resources](resources-and-tools/) (readings and tools)
* [Contact information](stay-in-touch.md) to connect with other relevant networks and communities

### Frequently Asked Questions - FAQs  üõ∂

Q: I am not feeling well, will you provide basic PPE (masks/sanitizing wipes)?

A: This is a mask-friendly event, and we encourage attendees to bring and wear masks for added protection against COVID-19. We encourage everyone who might feel under the weather to either attend via zoom OR come to the next Data Rescue event (if condition improves).

#### Q: What devices or equipment do I need to bring?

A: This is a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) sort of event meaning participants are invited to bring along whatever devices they might need to contribute their skills. If this means just a pen and paper, that‚Äôll do! NOTE: we do have a limited supply of laptops in case yours goes on the fritz last minute.

#### Q: How much programming or technical skills does a participant need?

A: For these Data Rescues, we only require surface level understanding of technology meaning do you know key differences between a physical and digital, do you have basic computer skills or have an interest in developing more, and can you understand the core threats to digital files like deletion and corruption?

#### Q: Is there anything I need to read or review in preparation for the event?

A: There is no required reading prior to attending the event, but you are welcomed to explore our [Gitbook documentation](https://community-archives.gitbook.io/data-rescue-2025) that shows suggested tasks, some potential readings, and overall information on the event structure.

#### Q: Do I need to be there the entire time?

A: No, these Data Rescue events are set up as Drop-Ins where most people can complete a digital preservation task within the hour. No one is expected to stay beyond that or arrive right at the start of the event.&#x20;

#### Q: Can I bring a friend?

A: Yes, friends and family (all ages) are welcome but please note that we are limited in in-person space. If more people arrive than we anticipated, we may ask you and your guest to move to our overflow spaces (both online or in-person). You are also welcomed to invite your friend to attend the next Data Rescue event.
