# üôè Community Agreements

At Data Rescue events, we strive to support and create an environment that encourages all participants‚Äîorganizers, supporters, any and all stakeholders to hold safe, engaging, and respectful environments where each person is able to focus as much of their energy on the Data Rescue‚Äôs intent.

The goal is to have community members collectively contribute a list of agreements, expectations, and a code of conduct that we can all agree upon with mutual respect. Please reference the below links for samples on Community Agreements that can be an inspiration to the ways we can hold space for and with each other during Data Rescue events.

We invite community members to suggest and/or share any other resources or samples that might be relevant and helpful as we build a welcoming and respectful environment towards our collective goals.
